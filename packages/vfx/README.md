## Introduction

`vfx` is a visual effects library for [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). It aims to be highly performant (with effects almost entirely simulated on the GPU) and easy to extend.

## Usage

Please do not use this in your own projects yet, as both API and functionality is still going to change _significantly_. But if you want to give the thing a whirl anyway, clone this repository and run:

```
yarn && yarn examples
```

Alternatively, you can [launch the examples app on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/hmans/vfx).
