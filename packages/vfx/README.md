> **Warning**
> This library is (extremely!) work-in-progress. **Use at your own risk.**

## Introduction 👋

`vfx` is a visual effects library for [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). It aims to be highly performant (with effects almost entirely simulated on the GPU) and easy to extend.

## Status ⚠️

This library is currently under heavy development, and is most definitely **not ready for any sort of production use whatsoever**. If you're interested in giving it a try, you are, however, invited to play with any of the example sandboxes listed below!

## Help Wanted! 🙏

If you're into visual effects and/or WebGL/Three.js development, **this library could benefit from your help**. There are a couple of issues and missing features that could use the help (or input) of people much more familiar with these domains than I am -- please [refer to the Roadmap](https://github.com/hmans/vfx/issues/4) for details.

## Examples & Demos 🎓

## Hacking & Development 🏗

But if you want to give the thing a whirl and do some hacking on it, clone this repository and run:

```
yarn && yarn examples
```

Alternatively, you can [launch the examples app on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/hmans/vfx).
