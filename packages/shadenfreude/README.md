# Shadenfreude

### /ShaÃÅdenfreude/, German: the joy of shading

An experiment in node-based shader composition.

## The Basics

Shadenfreude is a library for creating Three.js shaders assembled from a graph of nodes.

It is currently designed to work with [three-custom-shader-material](https://github.com/FarazzShaikh/THREE-CustomShaderMaterial).

**More coming soon. :b**
